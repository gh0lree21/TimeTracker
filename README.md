# Overview

This program is the result of two weeks and about 15 hours of 
learning Kotlin. I wanted to create something that
would teach me the skills of the basics behind the language
and that I could add to in the future. 

TimeTracker, as it is called now, is the framework for a program
that would eventually track the duration of any event or project
a person may work on. My hope is that in future versions the program
will have a database attached to store all of the data and will
compute the total amount of time spent on projects recorded in
the program. Although I used object-oriented programming, I was
not able to refine it as much as I would like. This truly is a 
'rough' draft.

Although far from complete, I feel that my work here has effectively
proven my basic knowledge of Kotlin classes, variables, loops, collections,
and more.

# Development Environment


* Kotlin Version 1.6.21
* Gradle
* kotlinx-datetime library

# Useful Websites


* [Declaring Repositories - Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html)
* [Kotlinx-datetime Library](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-datetime#using-in-your-projects)
* [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
* [Kotlin Advanced Tutorial: Collection Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4CpLxGJlq0)

# Future Work


* The program needs another class or two to handle the menu input that is abundant in the program
* The "Delete" option in the project menu does not remove a project from the projects list
* The use of the kotlinx-datetime library has not been fully utilized. The program is more 
of a temporary database than a stopwatch right now. But it's not far off.
